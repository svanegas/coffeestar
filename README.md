##Practice 2:
__Developed in:__ C++ and embedded Assembly

__Updates from version 1:__
* The visual part of the application was developed in *C++* whereas the business logic was made using embedded *Assembly*.
* Tables were included to the program in order to emulate a more complex coffee shop. That means that table clients can ask for additional coffes at any time and they are allowed to pay when leaving the store.
* Voluntary 10% tips were added for the tables bill of sale.
* Totals appear classified by tables, bar and there is a general total for the entire coffee house.
* A list of tables showing their availability or occupancy is presented to the cashier.
